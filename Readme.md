# StretchGymTimer

This is a little thing I wrote to remind me of stretching intervals and when I planned to go to gym. Wanted to experiment with [nuklear]() so  figured this would be a neat little way of dipping my toes in.

Intervals can be set from 1-5 hours, gym time is indicated by an hour in 24hr format, the file alert.wav contains whatever audio needs to be played for the alert sound.

Uses code cribbed from examples in [golang-ui/nuklear](https://github.com/golang-ui/nuklear) and [malgo](https://github.com/gen2brain/malgo)

May or may not play with this more in the future - I think it would be good to support more than just an hour alignment for gym, add hour/half hour/freestanding alignments for the stretch timer, maybe some flashing bits when alerts get triggered..
